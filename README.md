# About

This webiste generated using jemdoc+MathJax http://www.mit.edu/~wsshin/jemdoc+mathjax.html. 

Template forked from: https://dev10110.github.io/jemdocMathJaxMaterialize.html.

# Usage

*Updating:*

1. Write ```src/.jemdoc``` files (refer to jemdoc documentation). Assets should be saved in the ```src/assets/``` folder

2. Update ```src/MENU```


*Local Testing:*
```
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```
and then to enter the docker env:
```
docker exec -it  <docker container name> sh
```

To make the website, run (from inside the docker):
```
make
make search
```

To deploy the website
```
# clone the repo into the html folder
git clone git@github.com:dev10110/dev10110.github.io.git html
cd html
git checkout gh-pages 
```
build the website, and then
```
cd html
git add .
git commit -m "update website"
git push
```

## Old instructions:

*Local Testing:*

1. Activate a python 3 environment (python 2 should also work, but is untested)
```
conda create --name website python=3.8
conda activate webste
```
2. Run the make commands (from the root folder)
```
make clean      # optional, to completely delete the html folder

make            # or
make build      # to build to website

```
3. Open ```html/index.html``` in a browser

*Deploying*
```
./deploy.sh
```
requires the python env

This will run ```make clean & make```, and commit the files to the ```gh-pages``` branch.


## Settings

The make and deploy files are pretty short. Read through them to see what you can you change.

## Link checking
Link checking is performed using PyLinkValidator

Checking locally:

```
make
make serve    # Serve the html folder (ensure you have a python3 environment running), run the following from the root folder:
make check    # In a second terminal window, (with python3 environment and pylinkvalidate installed)
```
Which will print details on which links are broken

To check a live running website, simply run
```
pylinkvalidate.py --progress -o example.com
```

```-O``` checks external websites too.

## Search

Search is performed using ```lunr```, https://lunrjs.com

The implementation is lifted from https://github.com/BLE-LTER/Lunr-Index-and-Search-for-Static-Sites

Essentially, from the root folder
```
node install lunr
node install cheerio
```
The list of files that make search possible are:
```
build_index.js    # builds the search index
lunr_client.js    # for rendering the front end
lunr_index.js     # the search index json file
search.jemdoc     # compiled to html to render the search functionality
```

Check settings in ```build_index.js```. Currently it indexes all `html` files, and the body content is the set of content in the `div` with id `mainContentArea`

Process:

To make the search index, run (after the `html` files have been produced)
```
make search
```
from the root folder.



Disclaimer
----------
As per the original creators, 
> The focus of the implementation of the additional features was to "make them just work," so the implementation is suboptimal, both in terms of performance and style.  
>
> Still, several users and I find jemdoc+MathJax is quite stable and does the job correctly :-)
