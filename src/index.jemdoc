I am currently a senior researcher at LightSpeed Studios, Tencent America. Previously, I served as a postdoctoral associate in the [https://motion.cs.illinois.edu/ The Intelligent Motion Lab] under the supervision of [https://kkhauser.web.illinois.edu/ Prof. Kris Hauser]. I earned my Ph.D. in computer science from [https://cs.unc.edu/ the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill], where I had the privilege of being advised by [https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha Prof. Dinesh Manocha]. My doctoral research focused on planning and control algorithms for high-dimensional dynamic systems. Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I collaborated closely with [http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/hj/index.xml Prof. Jin Huang] on physics-based modeling. My current research interests include operations research, optimization-based motion planning & control, robot learning, and generative AI.
